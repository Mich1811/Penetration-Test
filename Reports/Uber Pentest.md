Non-Disclosure Statement

This report contains confidential information and intellectual property belonging to Uber Technologies, Inc., prepared exclusively by Studsvike Technologies under the APP100 penetration testing program.

Unauthorized distribution, reproduction, or disclosure is strictly prohibited.
All data was collected passively and ethically under HackerOne program rules.

Legal Notice

Testing activities were passive and conducted in full compliance with ethical hacking best practices.
No active exploitation, DoS, or social engineering was performed.
This report is for educational and internal security-assessment purposes only.

Executive Summary

Between July 26 and July 29, 2025, Studsvike Technologies conducted a passive reconnaissance-focused penetration test on Uber‚Äôs public assets.

Strengths

Uses trusted providers (UltraDNS, AWS) for reliable service.

Public APIs are properly secured ‚Äî no open endpoints found.

Top Risks

481 publicly visible sub-sites increase exposure.

Historical 2016 AWS key leak remains Uber‚Äôs most severe incident.

Predictable email formats simplify phishing attacks.

Recommended Actions

Rotate and secure all access keys immediately.

Automate monitoring for new subdomains and certificate changes.

Add backup DNS/hosting providers to avoid single-point failures.

Scope

Engagement Period: July 26‚Äì29, 2025
Testing Approach: Passive, non-intrusive reconnaissance only

In-Scope Assets

uber.com, ubereats.com, and related domains

Public-facing APIs (e.g., developer.uber.com)

Public breach databases, CT logs, GitHub, and search engines

Out-of-Scope

Active scans or brute-force attacks

DoS or phishing

Exploitation or unauthorized access

Methodology
Standards & Frameworks

PTES ‚Äì Penetration Testing Execution Standard

OWASP OSINT Framework

NIST SP 800-30 ‚Äì Risk Assessment Guidelines

Phases

Pre-Engagement & Planning

Defined scope and ROE.

Passive Reconnaissance

Used tools: Recon-ng, dig, nslookup, crt.sh, Wappalyzer, HaveIBeenPwned.

Data Aggregation & Analysis

Correlated subdomains, IPs, and tech stacks.

Validation & Reporting

Verified all findings via multiple passive sources.

Risk Rankings
Likelihood	Impact	Risk Level	Description
High	High	Critical	Immediate, low-effort exploit
Medium	High	High	Requires moderate skill
Low	Medium	Medium	Needs advanced correlation
Any	Low	Low	Minimal operational impact
Finding Summary
ID	Finding	Likelihood	Impact	Risk Level	CVSS
R1	Public subdomain enumeration	High	Low	Low	2.0
R2	DNS hosted on UltraDNS	Low	Medium	Low	3.7
R3	Public API visibility	Medium	Medium	Medium	6.5
R4	Historical AWS key leak (2016)	High	High	Critical	9.8
R5	Predictable email/AD naming	Medium	Medium	Medium	4.3
Findings & Evidences
7.1 Public Subdomain Exposure

Finding: 481 unique subdomains discovered under uber.com.

Risk Level: Low

Evidence: Recon-ng outputs via certificate_transparency and hackertarget.

7.2 DNS Infrastructure Hosted by UltraDNS

Risk Level: Low

Evidence:

edns126.ultradns.org
edns126.ultradns.net

7.3 Public API Visibility

Finding: No unauthenticated API endpoints found.

Risk Level: Medium

Evidence:
curl https://api.uber.com/v1/estimates/price ‚Üí 403 Forbidden

7.4 Historical AWS Key Leak (2016)

Finding: Legacy GitHub credential exposure.

Risk Level: Critical

Evidence: Confirmed by HaveIBeenPwned and public records.

7.5 Predictable Email Address Format

Finding: Uses first.last@uber.com pattern.

Risk Level: Medium

7.6 Cloud Hosting & Third-Party Dependencies

Finding: DNS/hosting via UltraDNS, Cloudflare, AWS.

Risk Level: High

Recommendations
8.1 Immediate Remediation (Critical & High)
Finding	Recommendation	Owner	Timeline
AWS Key Leak	Rotate keys, audit IAM, implement vaulting	Cloud Security	7 days
API Exposure	Enforce authentication, rate limits	API Engineering	14 days
DNS/CDN Dependencies	Multi-vendor DNS failover	Infrastructure	14 days
8.2 Mid-Term (Medium)
Finding	Recommendation	Owner	Timeline
Subdomain Sprawl	Automate monitoring	Threat Intel	30‚Äì45 days
Predictable Emails	Randomized naming for admins	IAM Team	30‚Äì60 days
8.3 Long-Term (Low)

Quarterly penetration tests

Harden server headers

Adopt WAF for exploit filtering

Steps to Produce
Subdomain and IP Discovery

Tool: Recon-ng

modules load recon/domains-hosts/hackertarget
modules load recon/domains-hosts/certificate_transparency
set SOURCE uber.com
run

Web Stack Analysis

Tool: Wappalyzer (browser extension)

Conclusion

Uber‚Äôs perimeter is generally resilient but exhibits legacy risks and surface visibility concerns.

Key Takeaways

Strong use of enterprise-grade DNS/CDN services.

No unauthenticated APIs found.

Legacy AWS key exposure remains critical.

481 public subdomains and predictable email formats increase OSINT exposure.

Next Steps

Rotate legacy credentials.

Automate subdomain monitoring and alerting.

Conduct quarterly external audits.
