## Non-Disclosure Statement
This report contains confidential information and intellectual property belonging to **Uber Technologies, Inc.**, prepared exclusively by **Studsvike Technologies** under the APP100 penetration testing program.

Unauthorized distribution, reproduction, or disclosure is strictly prohibited.  
All data was collected passively and ethically under **HackerOne program rules**.

## Executive Summary
Between **July 26 and July 29, 2025**, Studsvike Technologies conducted a **passive reconnaissance-focused penetration test** on Uber‚Äôs public assets.

### Strengths
- Uses trusted providers (UltraDNS, AWS) for reliable service.  
- Public APIs are properly secured ‚Äî no open endpoints found.

### Top Risks
- 481 publicly visible sub-sites increase exposure.  
- Historical 2016 AWS key leak remains Uber‚Äôs most severe incident.  
- Predictable email formats simplify phishing attacks.

### Recommended Actions
- Rotate and secure all access keys immediately.  
- Automate monitoring for new subdomains and certificate changes.  
- Add backup DNS/hosting providers to avoid single-point failures.

---

## Scope

**Engagement Period:** July 26‚Äì29, 2025  
**Testing Approach:** Passive, non-intrusive reconnaissance only  

### In-Scope Assets
- `uber.com`, `ubereats.com`, and related domains  
- Public-facing APIs (e.g., `developer.uber.com`)  
- Public breach databases, CT logs, GitHub, and search engines  

### Out-of-Scope
- Active scans or brute-force attacks  
- DoS or phishing  
- Exploitation or unauthorized access  

---

## Methodology

### Standards & Frameworks
- **PTES** ‚Äì Penetration Testing Execution Standard  
- **OWASP OSINT Framework**  
- **NIST SP 800-30** ‚Äì Risk Assessment Guidelines  

### Phases
1. **Pre-Engagement & Planning**
   - Defined scope and ROE.  
2. **Passive Reconnaissance**
   - Used tools: Recon-ng, `dig`, `nslookup`, crt.sh, Wappalyzer, HaveIBeenPwned.  
3. **Data Aggregation & Analysis**
   - Correlated subdomains, IPs, and tech stacks.  
4. **Validation & Reporting**
   - Verified all findings via multiple passive sources.

## Risk Rankings

| Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| High | High | **Critical** | Immediate, low-effort exploit |
| Medium | High | **High** | Requires moderate skill |
| Low | Medium | **Medium** | Needs advanced correlation |
| Any | Low | **Low** | Minimal operational impact |

### Finding Summary

| ID | Finding | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | CVSS |
|----|----------|-------------|---------|-------------|-------|
| R1 | Public subdomain enumeration | High | Low | Low | 2.0 |
| R2 | DNS hosted on UltraDNS | Low | Medium | Low | 3.7 |
| R3 | Public API visibility | Medium | Medium | Medium | 6.5 |
| R4 | Historical AWS key leak (2016) | High | High | **Critical** | 9.8 |
| R5 | Predictable email/AD naming | Medium | Medium | Medium | 4.3 |

## Findings & Evidences

### 7.1 Public Subdomain Exposure
- **Finding:** 481 unique subdomains discovered under `uber.com`.  
- **Risk Level:** Low  
- **Evidence:** Recon-ng outputs via `certificate_transparency` and `hackertarget`.

### 7.2 DNS Infrastructure Hosted by UltraDNS
- **Risk Level:** Low  
- **Evidence:**  
Web Stack Analysis

Tool: Wappalyzer (browser extension)

Conclusion

Uber‚Äôs perimeter is generally resilient but exhibits legacy risks and surface visibility concerns.

Key Takeaways

Strong use of enterprise-grade DNS/CDN services.

No unauthenticated APIs found.

Legacy AWS key exposure remains critical.

481 public subdomains and predictable email formats increase OSINT exposure.

Next Steps

Rotate legacy credentials.

Automate subdomain monitoring and alerting.

Conduct quarterly external audits.
